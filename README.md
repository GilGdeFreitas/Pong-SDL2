# Pong-SDL2

-----Goals-----
This project was made with the intent to replicate the work made by the youtuber NomNomNom069 when providing a tutorial to make a game in C++ using SDL. My plan was to update his work with SDL 2.0, instead of the version being used in the series (SDL 1.2).

-----Progress-----
This project is updated up to the episode 3 of the series(ep.3 included). It was put on hold due to my inability to continue this project, as it was very time consuming.
